The practice will work with approximately one third of the current children in care population for whom the care plan is long-term care (excepting children who receive social work services from the specialist Disabled Children in Care Team).\n\nBristol is committed to improving the experiences and outcomes for the most vulnerable children and young people in care, and empower social workers to do their jobs effectively whilst reducing bureaucracy. The social work practice model puts the child or young person at the heart of the service delivered with the aim of providing a more responsive service by bringing decision-making much closer to children and young people.\n\nThe Local Authority will maintain control of placement commissioning and the placement budget in order to continue to offer the value for money discounts currently achieved through preferring the in-house provision of foster care, and through framework agreements, cost and volume discounts and block arrangements with the independent sector.\n\nThe pilot is currently due to end on 13th November 2013 and the initial contract award period will be for two years with a possible extension by agreement for a further two years.  It is anticipated that in 2012 the Government will create the legislation that will enable the continuation of SWPs beyond the end of the pilot period.  This will be dependent upon a positive evaluation of the first round of pilot practices due in early 2012.\n\nLike most other Local Authorities, Bristol currently faces financial challenges that will impact on the delivery of services across the city.

The services range from support services such as HR and Financial Services to welfare services.  Some services must be provided statutorily, others are provided on a discretionary basis.  The costing data we hold is mixed in terms of quality and is difficult to rely on for decision making.  However the data we do have, suggests that we do not fully recover all our costs. Having considered all the options and issues relating to providing services to schools, including introducing a full cost recovery methodology, the decision has been taken in principle to cease all service provision to schools.  However it is recognised this decision has significant implications across the organisation and the judgement made is based upon limited information. The council wishes to commission a study to test the validity of the decision in principle.  We need assurance that this decision can be properly evidenced and all the organisational and policy implications are given due consideration.","Start Date":"03\/10\/2011","End Date":"03\/11\/2011","Extension Period Months":"0","Amount":"40725","Supplier Name":"Cambridge Education","Nominated Contact Point":"Bristol City Council.
